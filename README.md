# SANNI
This repository is related to the SANNI (Snippet and Artificial Neural Network-basedImputation) or the recovery of missing values in multivariate time series coming online. SANNI leverages behavioral patterns (called snippets) that are subsequences representing an actorâ€™s typical activities, which are reflected by the time series. SANNI is authored by Alexey Yurtin (iurtinaa@susu.ru) and Mikhail Zymbler (mzym@susu.ru), South Ural State University, Chelyabinsk, Russia.
